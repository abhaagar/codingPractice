static_cast<Type*>(ptr)
-----------------------
- performed at compile time.
- perform the cast if the type types are related otherwise get compiler error.


dynamic_cast<Type*>(ptr)
------------------------
- performed at run time.

Casts can go in two directions:
- base to derived (B2D).
   - not allowed implicitly and must done use proper cast operator.
- derived to base (D2B).
   - it is simple and allowed implicitly.
