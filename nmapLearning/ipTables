- FILTER – this is the default table, which contains the built in chains for:
   - INPUT  – packages destined for local sockets
   - FORWARD – packets routed through the system
   - OUTPUT – packets generated locally
- NAT – a table that is consulted when a packet tries to create a new connection. It has the following built-in:
   - PREROUTING – used for altering a packet as soon as it’s received
   - OUTPUT – used for altering locally generated packets
   - POSTROUTING – used for altering packets as they are about to go out
- MANGLE – this table is used for packet altering. 
  Until kernel version 2.4 this table had only two chains, but they are now 5:
   - PREROUTING – for altering incoming connections
   - OUTPUT – for altering locally generated  packets
   - INPUT – for incoming packets
   - POSTROUTING – for altering packets as they are about to go out
   - FORWARD – for packets routed through the box
