Host Discovery:
-iL Inpu from List, useful if the list of hosts is in a file.

DNS Resolution:
-n (No DNS resolution)
-R (DNS resolution for all targets)
--dns-servers <comma separated list of DNS servers>


Host Discovery Controls:
-sL list hosts with domain name. Usually done by reverse DNS lookup.
-sP 
-PN
- to skip host discovery stage use -sL -PN
Host Discovery Techniques:
- TCP SYN Ping (-PS)
  - sends an empty TCP packet with SYN flag set to port 80.
  - usage: -PS22-25,80,113
  - for unprivileged user, connect() is called that under the hood sends SYN packet.
  - some firewalls allows only outgoing TCP connections hence this probe is useless.
    packets in INVALID states are dropped.
- TCP ACK Ping (-PA)  
  - sends TCP packet with ACK flag set.
  - usage: -PA22-25,80,113
  - some firewalls keep track of state of TCP connection. Allow packets in NEW,ESTABLISHED
    state. This probe is useless for these firewalls.
- ARP scan (-PR)
  - used in scanning a LAN. 
  - normal TCP based scan fills up the ARP table and affects the performance.
- --packet-trace : used to print info all the packets sent.

Port Scanning:
- -sF,-sN,-sX 
  -sN don't set any bit in TCP flag.
  -sF set just TCP FIN bit.
  -sX set FIN, PSH, and URG flags.
  - any packet not containing SYN, RST, or ACk bits will result in a returned RST if the port
    is closed and no response at all if the port is open.
