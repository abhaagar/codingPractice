Physical vs. Virtual Networking:
1- Ethernet Port on the server – commonly called pNIC (physical NIC)
2- RJ45 Cable
3- Ethernet Port on the physical switch
4- Uplink Port on the physical switch – connects to external network.

Switch Ports:
 - Linux bridge is really a switch implemented inside Linux kernel.
 - Like any switch, it requires ports or interfaces to carry data traffic in and out of the switch.

 - Ethernet Port on VM (emulates the pNIC) – commonly knows as vNIC (Virtual NIC). 
   Virtual port is emulated with help from KVM/QEMU.
 - Virtual RJ45 Cable – we will see how this is created.
 - Ethernet Port on Virtual Switch – for Linux Bridge, this is represented by the tap 
   interface since it connects to a vNIC.
 - Uplink Port on the Virtual Switch – this is usually the interface that represent the pNIC. 
   In Linux world eth0, eth1 etc are the software interfaces that represent the physical ethernet port.
 - In case of a physical server, the Uplink port on physical switch provided external network connectivity. 
   In case of virtual machines, the Uplink port on virtual switch provides external network connectivity.

Tap Interfaces - Why do we need them?
 - Like their physical counterparts, virtual machines network ports can only process Ethernet frames. 
 - In non-virtualized environments, the physical NIC interface will receive and process the Ethernet frames. 
 - It will strip out the Ethernet related overhead bytes and forward the payload (usually IP packets) further up to the OS.
 - With virtualization however, this will not work since the virtual NICs would expect Ethernet frames. 
 - This is where tap interfaces come into picture. 
 - Tap interfaces are special software entities which tell the Linux bridge to forward Ethernet frames as it is. 
 - In other words, the virtual machines connected to tap interfaces will be able to receive raw Ethernet frames. 
 - And due to this virtual machines can continue to emulate physical machines from a networking perspective.

Linux Bridges:
 - brctl addbr <bridgeName>
 - brctl show
 - brctl addif <bridgeName> <interfaceName>
 - brctl delbr <bridgeName>
 - brctl showmacs <bridgeName>
