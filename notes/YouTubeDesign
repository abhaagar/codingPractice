Components:
1)- Storage
2)- Scalability
3)- Web Server
4)- Cache
5)- Recommendation System

Storage and Data model:
-----------------------
Schema:
User - id, name, email, password, address, age, registrationDate
Channel - id, ownerId, name
Subscriber - id, userId, channelId
Video - id, title, description, size, category, likes, viewCounts
Comments - id, videoId, userId,
category- id, name
Video and Image Storage:
  - Youtube has similar number of images as videos to serve in the forms of thumbnails.
  - Use CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve video images. CDN employs various techniques
    like replication, location specific storage, caching.
  - Hosting all the videos in CDN may be infeasible because of cost so use only popular videos
    to be served by CDN and rest from your on servers.
Web Server:
 - To scale you can have multiple replicas and build a load-balancer on top of them.
 - Server is mainly responsible for handling user requests and return response. The site should 
   have fewer heavy logics and everything else should be built into separate servers.
   For example, recommendation system.
