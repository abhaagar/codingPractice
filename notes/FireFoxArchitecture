- data that makes up a web page has 3 parts:
  1- code that represents the structure of a web page.
  2- code that provides style: the visual appearance of the structure.
  3- code that acts as a script of actions for the browser to take: computing, reacting to user actions, and modifying the structure and style beyond what was loaded initially.

- browser's parser first parses the html file to create an in-memory structure called DOM. DOM represents a tree like structure of HTML elements with properties, along with container and containee relationship.

- next comes the CSS (cascading style sheet) that captures the information about the appearance of the above parsed structures. Every element has by default some appearance, CSS overrides them.
  - A bit about CSS, it has two parts. 
  - First part is selector that describe the elements of the DOM being styled, 
  - and a list of declarations that specify the styles to be applied to elements that match the selector.

- browser engine parses the HTML code and create DOM.
- CSS parser parses the CSS defined and determine the appearance of DOM elements.
- STYLE ENGINE, takes the above to information and applies CSS to DOM.
