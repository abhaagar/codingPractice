TCP KeepAlive
Side A sends a TCP packet with ACK set with no data to side B (TCP keep alive is disabled by this host).
Side B sends a TCP packed with ACK set with no data to side A.
- checking dead peers.
- preventing disconnection by intermeddiate hops due to network inactivity.

TCP half open:
TCP connection between process Pa on host A and process Pb on host B is in established state, Suddenly either of the host dies without sending the info of it death to other side. Now Pb will continue to believe that connection is still active.
